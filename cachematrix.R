## For expensive computations, caching is a great technique to speed things up. 
## These function will cache the inverse of a matrix then return a cached copy
## to improve performance of that matrix.
## Both functions assume the input matrix is a square matrix that can be 
## inversed. 

## This function will cache the inverse of a matrix.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function will compute the inverse of a matrix if it isn't already 
## cached. If it is cached, it will return the cached version.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
